      <p>
        Hi! I'm Sreevishakh Vasudevan, a second-year Computer Science Master's student at 
        <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>, advised by 
        <a href="https://www.ransalu.com/">Prof. Ransalu Senanayake</a> and affiliated with the 
        <a href="https://www.ransalu.com/">Laboratory for Learning Evaluation and Naturalization of Systems (LENS)</a>.
        My research focuses on developing <strong>data-efficient methods for achieving robust and generalizable machine learning models</strong> with particular emphasis on <em>reinforcement learning</em>, <em>Bayesian optimization</em>, and 
        <em>vision-language-action systems</em> for robotics and autonomous agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before joining ASU, I spent <strong>3 years as a Machine Learning Engineer at LifeSignals</strong>, 
        where I designed deep learning and signal processing models for healthcare applications, including 
        transformer-based patient risk prediction, ECG analysis, and noninvasive blood pressure estimation. 
        I also worked at <strong>Deloitte USI</strong> on enterprise automation systems powered by ML pipelines. 
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the 
        <a href="https://www.cet.ac.in/">College of Engineering, Trivandrum</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m originally from Kerala, India. When I'm not doing research, I enjoy hiking and spending time in nature, exploring cities on foot or by public transport, and seeking out great stories through any medium, whether film, anime, music, or video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always happy to connect about research, share insights from industry experience, or collaborate on new ideas. 
        Feel free to reach out!
      </p>
